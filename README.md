# Image Classification of Emergency and Non-Emergency Vehicles
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify images of emergency and non-emergency vehicles. The model is built using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and trained on a dataset of images containing various types of emergency and non-emergency vehicles.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a set of images of emergency and non-emergency vehicles. The images were collected from various sources and labeled as either emergency or non-emergency based on their visual characteristics. The dataset contains a total of 1646 images for the emergency and non-emergency categories.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used for this project is VGG16, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model uses the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting

## Training and Evaluation
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer. The training and validation accuracy were monitored to ensure the model was not overfitting to the training data. The final model achieved an accuracy of 89% on the test set.

## Usage
To use the model for image classification, simply input an image of a vehicle and the model will output a prediction of whether the vehicle is an emergency or non-emergency vehicle. The model can be easily integrated into other applications or used as a standalone tool.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for image classification of emergency and non-emergency vehicles. The model achieved a good accuracy on the test data.
